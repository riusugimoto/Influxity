# Project Description:

A web application that allows users to monetize their personal data, providing
transparency and financial compensation when companies utilize the provided user data; the
users remain anonymous throughout the entire process. Companies can use the platform to find
users with relevant personal data and offer monetary compensation for access to this data.
Users can browse through a list of companies looking for specific data, view how much each
company is offering per person, and consider the quality of their data as a factor. If users have
relevant data to provide, they can click or tap on the listing to begin the process of uploading the
required data. Once the user has sent the relevant data, the company has the opportunity to
partially review the anonymized data for quality control and, if deemed sufficient, can accept it
and pay the anonymized user. The system includes an AI-based component (or a basic version,
if AI is not feasible) to provide company recommendations for users based on their listed
preferences and, if available, user history. Additionally, the component aids in optimizing data
pricing and provides insights for both users and companies. All users receive a transparency
report after each successful data transaction, where they can see the information of the
company that accepted their data, how much they were paid, what the company plans to do
with the data, notes/feedback, etc
